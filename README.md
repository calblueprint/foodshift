**[Food Shift](http://www.foodshift.net/)** is a nonprofit organization based in Oakland works collaboratively with communities, businesses and governments to develop long-term sustainable solutions to reduce food waste and build more resilient communities.  With an estimated 25% of food purchased being thrown away despite millions of Americans being food inseecure, there is definitely a problem.  Food Shift is trying to fix this problem through two approaches: education and awareness campaigns, and food recovery programs.

What We Are Doing
----
Blueprint is creating a web application to help coordinate the food recovery efforts.  The application will allow potential food donors to easily and efficiently set up one-time or recurring food donations, recipients to find food donations, and food shifters to help move food from donors to recipients.
