**[Food Shift](http://www.foodshift.net/)** is a nonprofit organization based in Oakland works collaboratively with communities, businesses and governments to develop long-term sustainable solutions to reduce food waste and build more resilient communities.  With an estimated 25% of food purchased being thrown away despite millions of Americans being food inseecure, there is definitely a problem.  Food Shift is trying to fix this problem through two approaches: education and awareness campaigns, and food recovery programs.

What We Are Doing
----
Blueprint is creating a web application to help coordinate the food recovery efforts.  The application will allow potential food donors to easily and efficiently set up one-time or recurring food donations, potential food recipients to find out and sign up for food donations, and food shifters to help move food from donors to recipients.

**[Cal Blueprint](http://www.calblueprint.org/)** is a student-run UC Berkeley organization devoted to matching the skills of its members to their desire to see social good enacted in their community. Each semester, teams of 4-5 students work closely with a non-profit to bring technological solutions to the problems they face every day.
